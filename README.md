MkPFS is a command-line tool and Python library for building, verifying, inspecting, browsing, and extracting PlayStation FileSystem (PFS) disk images. It works with common image naming conventions such as `.ffpfs`, `.ffpfsc`, `.pfs`, `.dat`, and `.bin`, and fits both direct image workflows and PKG or FPKG inner-PFS generation.

## 🎯 Why MkPFS

MkPFS is designed to be a clean and practical entry point for PlayStation PFS image workflows:

- Create and manage PFS disk images for PlayStation-oriented workflows
- Verify structure, payload hashes, layout consistency, and source-tree matches
- Inspect image contents quickly with a tree view instead of digging through raw structures
- Work with common image extensions such as `.ffpfs`, `.ffpfsc`.
- Use the generated images with tools like [MicroMount](https://github.com/drakmor/ShadowMountPlus) and [ShadowMountPlus](https://github.com/drakmor/ShadowMountPlus)
- Build the inner PFS filesystem used inside PKG or FPKG workflows
- Use the same core workflow from both the CLI and the Python library
- Explore a bundled, source-backed knowledge base for PFS and PKG research

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install/Update using pip
python -m pip install -U "mkpfs"

# Creating Images: Option 1: .exfat -> .ffpfsc (Works with ShadowMountPlus)  (Maximum compatibility)
python -m mkpfs pack file './BREW1234.exfat' './BREW1234.ffpfsc'

# Creating Images: Option 2: .ffpkg -> .ffpfsc (Works with ShadowMountPlus) 
python -m mkpfs pack file './BREW1234.ffpkg' './BREW1234.ffpfsc'

# Creating Images: Option 3: Game folder -> .ffpfsc in one pass (default: exFAT-wrapped, no temp file)
python -m mkpfs pack folder './BREW1234-app' './BREW1234.ffpfsc'

# Creating Images: Option 4: Game folder packed directly as PFS (advanced)
python -m mkpfs pack folder --raw './BREW1234-app/' './BREW1234.ffpfs'

# Extracting Existing Images (Reverse operation; --deep lists/extracts inside a wrapped exFAT)
python -m mkpfs unpack './BREW1234.ffpfsc' './BREW1234-extracted/' --deep
```

## ⚠️ Limitations and Known Issues

- `exfat->ffpfsc` is the most stable format for compressed game backups. `pack folder` produces this layout by
  default: it wraps the folder in an exFAT image and compresses that into the `.ffpfsc` in a single pass, with no
  temporary `.exfat` on disk.
- `pack folder --raw` packs the folder directly into a PFS image without the exFAT wrapper. When file compression is
  enabled, the image is created and verification passes, but the console reads the files incorrectly due to technical
  limitations, so this advanced option provides no practical benefit for game backups. Prefer the default wrapped
  layout.
- With the default `--block-size 65536`, very small files can cause significant block-alignment waste, which may make
  the resulting image larger than the source in corner cases.
    - For small-file-heavy folders, prefer the two-pass strategy (`raw-folder -> .dat -> .ffpfsc`) or try a smaller
      block size such as `--block-size 16384` or `--block-size 32768`.
- Antivirus scanning can reduce conversion speed, especially during the write phase or when processing many loose
  files. If you trust this software in your environment and need higher throughput, temporarily disabling real-time
  scanning can help. If you are unsure, keep antivirus enabled and expect slower conversions.

## 📊 Compression Statistics

Using the compression from MkPFS, you can have your game files reduced by **40-60%**, drastically reducing the size of the image. 
The PlayStation kernel is already able to read the files natively in the PFSC format with minimal performance impact!

The numbers below are measured from a real homebrew title that previously had 6.5 GB of game files:

| Format | Description | Size    | Space saved     |
| --- | --- |---------|-----------------|
| `.exfat` | Raw game image (exFAT) | ~6.5 GB | baseline        |
| `.ffpkg` | Raw game image (UFS) | ~6.5 GB | baseline        |
| `.exfat.ffpfsc` | PFSC-compressed wrapper around the exFAT image | ~3.4 GB | **-47%**        |
| `.ffpkg.ffpfsc` | PFSC-compressed wrapper around the UFS image | ~3.4 GB | **-47%**        |
| `.ffpfs` | Source folder packed directly into a PFSC image | ~3.5 GB | **-46%** |

Both single-file wrapping (`pack file`) and folder-based packing (`pack folder`) produce compressed images of equivalent size, giving you flexibility without sacrificing efficiency.

## Command Reference

MkPFS keeps the command surface focused on the image lifecycle. 
The CLI currently supports `pack`, `verify`, `inspect`, `tree`, and `unpack`.

### Top-level CLI

```text
mkpfs [-h] {pack,verify,inspect,tree,unpack} ...
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show the top-level help text and exit. |
| `pack` | Pack a folder or a single file into a PFS image. |
| `verify` | Validate image structure and payload checksums. |
| `inspect` | Inspect image metadata and integrity summary. |
| `tree` | Print the image tree representation. |
| `unpack` | Extract files from an image into a destination directory. |

### `pack`

```text
mkpfs pack [-h] {folder,file,exfat} ...
```

Use `pack folder` to build a PS image from a directory tree, `pack file` to treat one file as a virtual single-file tree, or `pack exfat` to build a raw `.exfat` image from a directory tree without compressing it into a `.ffpfsc`.

### `pack folder`

By default, `pack folder` wraps the folder in an exFAT image and compresses that into the `.ffpfsc` in a single pass, with no temporary `.exfat` on disk (the most PS-compatible layout). Use `--raw` to instead pack the folder directly into a PFS image.

| `--max-compressed-ratio MAX_COMPRESSED_RATIO` | Maximum PFSC size as percent of the raw file size. Use `100` to store files raw only when PFSC is larger than the raw file. Default: `100`.                                                                                                    |
| `--min-compress-size MIN_COMPRESS_SIZE` | Store files smaller than this many bytes raw without trying PFSC compression. When omitted (or set to `0`), MkPFS uses the resolved `--block-size` value, `65536` for `--block-size auto`, or the selected value for `--block-size auto-fit`. |

Notes:

- Folder output names are adjusted automatically by default.
- MkPFS chooses `.ffpfs` when `sce_sys/param.json` exposes a title ID, otherwise it falls back to `.ffpfsc`.
- When the source folder contains `fakelib/libSceAmpr.sprx`, MkPFS regenerates an `ampr_emu.index` in the folder before packing so it is included in the image and stays in sync with the current files. The rebuild is metadata-only and inexpensive. Use `--no-ampr-index` to skip it and preserve any existing index.
- OS-generated metadata is never packed: macOS entries (`.DS_Store`, `._*`, `__MACOSX`, `.Spotlight-V100`, ...) and Windows entries (`Thumbs.db`, `desktop.ini`, `$RECYCLE.BIN`, ...) are skipped during scanning and excluded from the AMPR index.
- `--ekpfs-key` is only meaningful when used with `--encrypted`.

| `--max-compressed-ratio MAX_COMPRESSED_RATIO` | Maximum PFSC size as percent of the raw file size. Use `100` to store files raw only when PFSC is larger than the raw file. Default: `100`.                                                                |
| `--min-compress-size MIN_COMPRESS_SIZE`       | Store files smaller than this many bytes raw without trying PFSC compression. When omitted (or set to `0`), MkPFS uses the resolved `--block-size` value, `65536` for `--block-size auto`, or the selected value for `--block-size auto-fit`.                                              |
| `--rename-inner-image`                          | Rename inner image filename to a safe normalized name (default).                                                                                                                                        |

| `--use-spool`                                   | Force the legacy staged/spool builder for single-file packing instead of the default direct-to-image streaming.                                                                                       |
| `--skip-executable-compression`                 | Skip compression in important executable files. Default: enabled.                                                                                                                                       |

Notes:

- `pack file` now uses the direct-to-image streaming builder by default for supported option combinations. It
  automatically falls back to the legacy staged/spool path for `--signed`, `--inode-bits 64`, and
  `--block-size auto-fit`, printing a short notice that explains the reason.
- Use `--use-spool` to force the legacy staged/spool builder even when streaming is supported.
- Single-file fallback mode stages the file in a temporary one-file tree using links, so the source payload is not
  duplicated on disk.
- Use `--temp-folder` when you want fallback staged files and any legacy PFSC spool files to live somewhere other than
  the system temp directory.
- The default adjusted extension for single-file output is `.ffpfsc`.
- If `pack file` fails on macOS with `OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument` during PFSC compression, rerun with `--cpu-count 1` to keep block compression in-process.
  If the source lives on a removable or network volume, also try a local `--temp-folder` on a writable APFS volume.

### `pack exfat`

Build a raw exFAT image from a source directory, without compressing it into a `.ffpfsc`. This is useful when you want a standalone `.exfat` to inspect, mount, or pass to `pack file` later. The same exFAT layout is produced cross-platform, with no external `mkexfat` tooling required.

```text
mkpfs pack exfat [-h] [--cluster-size CLUSTER_SIZE] [--overwrite] [--verbose] source_dir [output]
```

Examples:

```bash
mkpfs pack exfat ./BREW1234-app ./BREW1234.exfat
mkpfs pack exfat ./BREW1234-app          # auto-name <titleId>.exfat alongside the source
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `source_dir` | Source app or homebrew folder to pack. |
| `output` | Output `.exfat` path, or a directory to auto-name `<titleId>.exfat`. When omitted, the image is written alongside the source. |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show help and exit. |
| `--cluster-size CLUSTER_SIZE` | exFAT cluster size in bytes or `auto`. Default: `auto` (32 KiB, or 64 KiB for trees with a large average file size). |
| `--overwrite` | Overwrite an existing output file. |
| `--verbose` | Print verbose output. |

Notes:

- OS-generated metadata is excluded from the image (see the `pack folder` notes for the full list).
- The resulting `.exfat` can be packed straight into a `.ffpfsc` with `mkpfs pack file ./BREW1234.exfat ./BREW1234.ffpfsc`.

### `verify`

```text
mkpfs verify [-h] [--source-dir SOURCE_DIR | --source-file SOURCE_FILE]
             [--expect-crc32 EXPECT_CRC32]
             [--expect-manifest-sha256 EXPECT_MANIFEST_SHA256]
             [--ekpfs-key EKPFS_KEY] [--new-crypt] image_file
```

Examples:

```bash
mkpfs verify ./game.ffpfs
mkpfs verify ./single.ffpfsc --source-file ./payload.exfat
mkpfs verify ./game.ffpfs --source-dir ./input --expect-crc32 0x7F528D1F
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `image_file` | Path to the input `.ffpfs` image. |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show help and exit. |
| `--source-dir SOURCE_DIR` | Optional source folder for hierarchy and payload comparison. |
| `--source-file SOURCE_FILE` | Optional source file for single-file image comparison. Mutually exclusive with `--source-dir`. |
| `--expect-crc32 EXPECT_CRC32` | Expected cumulative data CRC32 in hex. Verification fails if the computed value differs. |
| `--expect-manifest-sha256 EXPECT_MANIFEST_SHA256` | Expected manifest SHA256 as 64 hex characters. Verification fails if it differs. |
| `--ekpfs-key EKPFS_KEY` | Optional 64-hex EKPFS key for encrypted images. |
| `--new-crypt` | Use the alternate `newCrypt` EKPFS derivation. |

### `inspect`

```text
mkpfs inspect [-h] [--format {text,json}] [--ekpfs-key EKPFS_KEY] [--new-crypt] image_file
```

Examples:

```bash
mkpfs inspect ./game.ffpfs
mkpfs inspect ./game.ffpfs --format json
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `image_file` | Path to the input `.ffpfs` image. |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show help and exit. |
| `--format {text,json}` | Output format for the inspection report. Default: `text`. |
| `--ekpfs-key EKPFS_KEY` | Optional 64-hex EKPFS key for encrypted images. |
| `--new-crypt` | Use the alternate `newCrypt` EKPFS derivation. |

### `tree`

mkpfs tree [-h] [--deep] [--ekpfs-key EKPFS_KEY] [--new-crypt] image_file
```

Examples:

```bash
mkpfs tree ./game.ffpfs
mkpfs tree ./game.ffpfsc --deep
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `image_file` | Path to the input `.ffpfs` image. |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show help and exit. |
| `--deep` | When the image wraps a single exFAT, list the files inside it instead of the inner `.exfat`. |
| `--ekpfs-key EKPFS_KEY` | Optional 64-hex EKPFS key for encrypted images. |
| `--new-crypt` | Use the alternate `newCrypt` EKPFS derivation. |

### `unpack`

```text
mkpfs unpack [-h] [--overwrite] [--deep] [--ekpfs-key EKPFS_KEY] [--new-crypt] image_file output_dir
```

Examples:

```bash
mkpfs unpack ./game.ffpfs ./extracted/
mkpfs unpack ./game.ffpfs ./extracted/ --overwrite
mkpfs unpack ./game.ffpfsc ./extracted/ --deep
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `image_file` | Path to the input `.ffpfs` image. |
| `output_dir` | Destination directory for extraction. |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show help and exit. |
| `--overwrite` | Overwrite an existing output path. |
| `--deep` | When the image wraps a single exFAT, extract the files inside it instead of the inner `.exfat`. |
| `--ekpfs-key EKPFS_KEY` | Optional 64-hex EKPFS key for encrypted images. |
| `--new-crypt` | Use the alternate `newCrypt` EKPFS derivation. |
